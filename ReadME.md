Description:
The script helps you find AMI in a region that you desire to know, instead of typing the command alone or going into AWS website.

Introduction:
I create the script to make it easier to find what you need inside aws, 
in my new update, i plan to connect to the main script that I create 
which will set up the ec2,VPC,TAGS, automatically  

Installation:
Before run the script please make sure to run this command 
pip install -r requirements.txt
inside your terminal 

Make sure you config aws by
aws configure
or in ./aws folder and add the credentials
